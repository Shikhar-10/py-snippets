# Built-in Data Types 

# 1. Numeric Data Type
a = -2                                                  # Integer
print (f"a is {a} and its type is {type(a)}")
b = 3.14                                                # Float
print (f"b is {b} and its type is {type(b)}")
c = 1 + 2j                                              # Complex number
print (f"c is {c} and its type is {type(c)}")

# 2. String Data Type
d = "Hello, World!"                                     # String
print (f"d is {d} and its type is {type(d)}")

# 3. Boolean Data Type
e = False                                               # Boolean
print (f"e is {e} and its type is {type(e)}")

# 4. Sequence Data Type
f = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]              # List
print (f"f is {f} and its type is {type(f)}")
g = (4, 3.14, ("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger")) # Tuple
print (f"g is {g} and its type is {type(g)}")

# 5. Mapping Data Type
h = {"name":"Shikhar", "age":21, "Country":"India"}     # Dictionary
print (f"h is {h} and its type is {type(h)}")
